TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale. Detecting errors in code without running it is referred to as static checking. Determining what‚Äôs an error and what‚Äôs not based on the kinds of values being operated on is known as static type checking.

TypeScript checks a program for errors before execution, and does so based on the kinds of values, it‚Äôs a static type checker.
